[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jk1/youtrack-idea-plugin.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jk1/TeamCity-dependencies-gradle-plugin)

###Development

To get an Idea project open ```build.gradle``` file with Intellij Idea and follow import instructions.

Handy development tasks:

- ```./gradlew assemble``` to build plugin in build/distributions

- ```./gradlew tests``` to run tests

- ```./gradlew runIdea``` to run IntelliJ IDEA with YouTrack plugin enabled
